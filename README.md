# Fast-Travel-Dimension-Datapack-Minecraft
Minecraft Datapack

This data pack creates a custom dimension in which one block is equal to 100 blocks in the overworld.

The structure of the portal is explained in the video given above.


To check if the portal is activated or not just see if there is a dragon egg floating at the top of the portal.

Careful when teleporting other entities through the portal as it doesn't really work well.
